Grandma used to pray out loud
By her bed every night
To me it sounded like mumblin'
Like she was out of her mind

She said: Boy, this kind of prayin'
Is what saved my life
You oughta try it some time
And now I know she was right

She was talkin' to Jesus
She was talkin' to Jesus
And she'd been talkin' to Jesus
For all of her life

Mama used to drag me to church
Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights
Khaki pants and a polo shirt
Boy, I put up a fight

She said: Son, one day, you'll thank me
For having God in your life
And yeah, I know she was right
Yeah, my mama was right

'Cause now I'm talkin' to Jesus
She got me talkin' to Jesus
She got me talkin' to Jesus
Yeah, my mama was right
'Cause now I'm talkin' to Jesus
Yeah, I love talkin' to Jesus
And I'll be talkin' to Jesus
For the rest of my life

What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus (don't you know?)
What a friend we have in Jesus, oh
What a friend we have!
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus, oh

I've got three of my own now
Tryin' to raise them up right
My oldest is fifteen
And I remember what that was like

Tryin' to deal with the drama
Tryin' to figure out the questions in life
And I've been lookin' for a way to show him
How to make it alright

Then he walked in my room
While I was sayin' my prayers the other night
He said: I'll come back later
I can tell you got a lot on your mind

I said: It's not an interruption
You couldn't have picked a better time
'Cause I was just talkin' to Jesus
Come over and give it a try

We started talkin' to Jesus
We started talkin' to Jesus
We started talkin' to Jesus, oh
And now he's talkin' to Jesus
Thank God, he's talkin' to Jesus
I hope he's talkin' to Jesus
For the rest of his life, yeah

What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus, oh
What a friend we have!
What a friend we have in Jesus (aren't you glad you have a friend?)
What a friend we have in Jesus (none more faithful, none more true)
What a friend we have in Jesus, oh

There's no wrong way to do it
There's no bad time to start
It don't have to sound pretty
Just tell Him what's on your heart

'Cause it's not a religion, no
'Cause it's more like a friendship
So just talk to your Father
Like you are His kid

Just start talkin' to Jesus
Just start talkin' to Jesus
'Cause you can talk to Jesus
Oh, whenever you like
Just start talkin' to Jesus
Just start talkin' to Jesus
Just keep talkin' to Jesus
For the rest of your life

Oh, just talk, oh
Just talk, just talk, just talk to Jesus

What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus, oh
What a friend we have!
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus (so faithful, so true)
What a friend we have in Jesus, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, just talk the words
Just let it out, let it out, let it out right now
Let it out, let it out, let it out, let it out right now
Let it out, let it out, let it out

What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus
What a friend we have in Jesus, oh
(He's so close, He's so close)
What a friend we have in Jesus
(Yeah, He's right in front of you)
What a friend we have in Jesus
(Just talk to Jesus)
What a friend we have in Jesus, oh

What a friend!
What a friend we have in Jesus
(Just keep talkin' to Jesus)
What a friend we have in Jesus
(Oh, just keep talkin' to Jesus)
What a friend we have in Jesus (just keep talkin' to Jesus), oh
